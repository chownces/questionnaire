# Questionnaire API
This repository contains a RESTful API designed for a questionnaire application, written in [Django Rest Framework (DRF)](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/). For a simplified implementation, authentication is not implemented, and all endpoints are public.

A summary of the API can be found in the [Endpoints](#Endpoints) and [API Summary](#API-Summary) sections below.

As this is my first project using DRF and was done within a week, the codebase might not be as polished as it can be ðŸ˜….

A demo of this project is deployed on Heroku [here](https://qns-api.herokuapp.com/forms/). Do note that it may take up to a minute for the app to load initially, as it is deployed on Heroku's free tier.

## Endpoints
* `/forms`:
    * [`GET`](#GET-forms-and-GET-formsid): Get all forms
    * [`POST`](#POST-forms-and-PUT-formsid): Create a new form
* `/forms/:id`:
    * [`GET`](#GET-forms-and-GET-formsid): Get form by id
    * [`PUT`](#POST-forms-and-PUT-formsid): Update form by id 
        * Note that all existing submissions and answers related to the form will be deleted in the current simplified implementation
* `/submissions`:
    * [`GET`](#GET-submissions-and-GET-submissionsid): Get all submissions
    * [`POST`](#POST-submissions-and-PUT-submissionsid): Create a new submission
* `/submissions/:id`:
    * [`GET`](#GET-submissions-and-GET-submissionsid): Get submission by id
    * [`PUT`](#POST-submissions-and-PUT-submissionsid): Update submission by id
    
## Assumptions
1. The frontend will preprocess the form data or CSV file into JSON before sending information to this API
1. The answers sent to the `/submissions` endpoint will be given in the `display_order` of questions in the specified form.

## Getting Started
### Local Development
1. Install a stable release of Python (e.g. version 3.8).
1. Clone this repository and navigate to it using "cd" in your command line or shell tool.
1. Run `pip3 install -r requirements_dev.txt` to install all dependencies.
1. Setup the database via `python manage.py migrate`.
1. Run `python manage.py runserver` to start the server at `http://localhost:8000`

### Deployment to production
1. The deployment configuration for Heroku is already set up on the `heroku` branch. To deploy:
    * Set up a new app on Heroku, and provision a Postgres database add-on
    * Deploy the `heroku` branch of this repository to the above app on Heroku
    * Run `python manage.py migrate` on this Heroku app to setup the Postgres database

## Development
### Running Tests
Before pushing to GitHub, ensure that your code is formatted and your tests are passing.
* `black .`: Run this at the top of your project directory. Formats your code. Ensure dev dependencies are installed before running this.
* `python manage.py test`: Runs the test suite.

## Future Extensions
1. Enable filtering of submissions by form id in URL parameters
1. Store answers to radio and checkbox questions properly as integers in the database
    * Currently, the answers to these questions are stored as text for a simplified implementation
    * One possible approach to handling checkbox answers is documented [here](https://www.sqlservercentral.com/articles/storing-checkbox-responses-as-integers)
1. Authentication
    * Only authenticated users can submit and/or edit their own forms
    * Forms should not be editable by other users
    * Only form admins can view all submissions to the form
    * Implementation details will depend on usecase
1. Forms can be shared with others via a unique link

## API Summary
